**Sprint:** 4 - Advanced Analytics & Enterprise Features  
**Project:** SparkApply - AI-Powered Job Application Platform

## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation of the enterprise integration features in Sprint 4. These features are crucial for SparkApply to connect with external systems, enabling seamless data flow and enhanced functionality for enterprise clients.

## 2. ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Integrations

The ATS integration service allows SparkApply to connect with various ATS platforms, enabling the synchronization of jobs, candidates, and applications.

### Supported Platforms

*   Workday
*   BambooHR
*   Greenhouse

### Configuration

To enable an ATS integration, you need to provide the platform name and the necessary credentials in the API request to the `/api/enterprise/ats/sync` endpoint.

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "platform": "workday",
  "credentials": {
    "tenant": "your-tenant",
    "accessToken": "your-access-token"
  }
}
```

## 3. HRIS (Human Resource Information System) Integrations

The HRIS integration service allows SparkApply to connect with various HRIS platforms, enabling the synchronization of employee data.

### Supported Platforms

*   SAP SuccessFactors

### Configuration

To enable an HRIS integration, you need to provide the platform name and the necessary credentials in the API request to the `/api/enterprise/hris/sync` endpoint.

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "platform": "sap-successfactors",
  "credentials": {
    "api_url": "your-api-url",
    "accessToken": "your-access-token"
  }
}
```

## 4. Bulk Operations

The bulk operations functionality allows enterprise clients to import and export large volumes of data.

*   **Import:** `POST /api/enterprise/bulk/import` - Upload a file to import data.
*   **Export:** `GET /api/enterprise/bulk/export` - Export data to a file.

## 5. Deployment

The `enterprise-integration-service` is a new microservice that needs to be deployed alongside the other SparkApply services. The service is located in `/packages/api/enterprise-integration-service`.

To deploy the service, you need to:

1.  Build the Docker image for the service.
2.  Push the image to a container registry.
3.  Update the Kubernetes deployment configuration to include the new service.
