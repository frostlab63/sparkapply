**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Sprint:** 5 - Advanced AI & Innovation Features  
**Project:** SparkApply - AI-Powered Job Application Platform

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the AI-powered interview preparation system to be implemented in Sprint 5. This system will provide users with personalized interview coaching, including question generation and feedback on their answers.

## 2. Interview Preparation Service Architecture

The `interview-preparation-service` is a new microservice that will provide the AI-powered interview coaching features. This service is designed to be intelligent, responsive, and helpful.

### 2.1. Service Components

- **`InterviewCoachService`**: This service is responsible for interacting with the OpenAI API to generate interview questions and provide feedback on user answers.
- **`InterviewPreparationController`**: This controller will handle incoming API requests, pass the data to the `InterviewCoachService`, and return the generated questions or feedback to the client.
- **`interviewPreparation` Routes**: These are the API endpoints for accessing the interview preparation features.

### 2.2. Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: The service will be built on Node.js.
- **Express.js**: Express.js will be used as the web framework.
- **OpenAI API**: This service will be used for generating questions and providing feedback.
- **Jest**: Jest will be used for testing.

## 3. Data Flow

### 3.1. Question Generation

1. The user provides a job description to the client application.
2. The client application sends the job description to the `interview-preparation-service`.
3. The `generateQuestions` route receives the request.
4. The `InterviewPreparationController` passes the job description to the `InterviewCoachService`.
5. The `InterviewCoachService` sends the job description to the OpenAI API with a prompt to generate interview questions.
6. The OpenAI API returns a list of questions.
7. The questions are returned to the client application.

### 3.2. Feedback Provision

1. The user provides an interview question and their answer to the client application.
2. The client application sends the question and answer to the `interview-preparation-service`.
3. The `provideFeedback` route receives the request.
4. The `InterviewPreparationController` passes the question and answer to the `InterviewCoachService`.
5. The `InterviewCoachService` sends the question and answer to the OpenAI API with a prompt to provide feedback using the STAR method.
6. The OpenAI API returns feedback on the user's answer.
7. The feedback is returned to the client application.

## 4. Deployment and Scalability

The `interview-preparation-service` will be deployed as a containerized application on a Kubernetes cluster.

### 4.1. Deployment Strategy

- The service will be deployed as a separate microservice within the SparkApply ecosystem.
- A CI/CD pipeline will be set up to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the service.

### 4.2. Scalability

- The service will be designed to be horizontally scalable.
- The use of the OpenAI API will ensure that the question generation and feedback provision are highly scalable and performant.
