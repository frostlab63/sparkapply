# ðŸš€ GitHub Actions Workflow Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

Follow these exact steps to add the GitHub Actions workflow and complete the CI/CD implementation:

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/frostlab63/sparkapply
2. Make sure you're logged in and have write access

### Step 2: Create the Workflow File
1. Click the **"Actions"** tab at the top of the repository
2. If you see "Get started with GitHub Actions", click **"set up a workflow yourself"**
3. If you see existing workflows, click **"New workflow"** â†’ **"set up a workflow yourself"**

### Step 3: Replace the Default Content
1. You'll see a file editor with a default workflow
2. **Delete all the default content** in the editor
3. **Copy the entire workflow content** from the file I'm providing below
4. **Paste it** into the GitHub editor

### Step 4: Name and Save the Workflow
1. Change the filename from `main.yml` to `ci-cd.yml`
2. Click **"Commit changes..."** (green button)
3. Add commit message: `feat: Add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline workflow`
4. Click **"Commit changes"**

## âœ… Verification Steps

After adding the workflow:

1. **Check Actions Tab**: Go to Actions tab and verify the workflow appears
2. **Trigger First Run**: Make a small change to README.md and push to trigger the workflow
3. **Monitor Execution**: Watch the workflow run and ensure all jobs pass

## ðŸ”§ Workflow Features

This workflow includes:
- âœ… **Automated Testing**: Frontend, backend, and E2E tests
- âœ… **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier checks
- âœ… **Security Scanning**: Dependency vulnerability checks
- âœ… **Build Verification**: Frontend and backend builds
- âœ… **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment on main branch
- âœ… **Artifact Management**: Build artifacts and test reports

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Results

Once added, the workflow will:
1. **Run on every push** to master/main/develop branches
2. **Run on pull requests** to master/main branches
3. **Execute all tests** and quality checks
4. **Deploy to staging** automatically on main branch
5. **Generate reports** and artifacts

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

- The workflow uses **pnpm** as the package manager
- It requires **Node.js 22.x** (already configured in the project)
- **PostgreSQL service** is automatically started for backend tests
- **Playwright browsers** are installed for E2E tests
- **Build artifacts** are saved for 7 days

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps After Adding Workflow

1. **First Run**: Push a small change to trigger the workflow
2. **Monitor Results**: Check that all jobs pass successfully
3. **Fix Any Issues**: Address any failing tests or build issues
4. **Configure Secrets**: Add any required secrets in repository settings
5. **Set Up Environments**: Configure staging environment protection rules

---

**This completes the CI/CD implementation! The workflow will now automatically test, build, and deploy your code on every push.**
